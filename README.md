# JPA-Hibernate-Practice-1

This Project is been created to get Hands on JPA(Java Persistence API), it has one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many relations. JPA avoids writing DDL in a database-specific dialect of SQL. Instead of this, it allows mapping in XML or using Java annotations. Spring Boot JPA is a Java specification for managing relational data in Java applications. It allows us to access and persist data between Java object/ class and relational database. JPA follows Object-Relation Mapping (ORM). It's just a specification while hibernate is it's implementation.
